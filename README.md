## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a project focused on analyzing and predicting landslide occurrences using deep learning techniques. The project explores two primary, potentially interconnected, approaches:

1.  **Combining Geographical and Atmospheric Data:** This approach, detailed in `Report.pdf` and implemented in notebooks like `Major-1-train.ipynb`, `Major-2-Predict.ipynb`, and `Major-3-oso.ipynb`, aims to improve landslide prediction by integrating various geographical factors with atmospheric data using a U-net deep learning model.
2.  **Utilizing DInSAR Technique:** This approach, hinted at in the abstract of the "Detection And Prediction..." PDF and potentially explored in notebooks like `Estimate-OSO.ipynb`, focuses on using Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) to analyze land deformation as a key indicator for landslide vulnerability, also employing a U-net model. The SR-530 Oso landslide serves as a significant case study in this context.

The repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that cover data processing, model training, prediction, and analysis for both of these methodologies.

## Key Activities and Approaches

* **Data Integration:** Combining diverse datasets, including geographical information (potentially derived from satellite imagery using SNAP and analyzed with ArcGIS Pro) and atmospherical data.
* **Deep Learning with U-net:** Utilizing the U-net architecture for semantic segmentation, aiming to identify and predict areas susceptible to landslides based on the input features.
* **Land Deformation Analysis (DInSAR):** Investigating the use of DInSAR techniques to detect subtle surface changes that can precede landslides, particularly highlighted in the context of the OSO landslide case study.
* **Case Study Validation:** Focusing on the SR-530 Oso landslide as a critical case for validating the developed models and methodologies.
* **Correlation Analysis:** Exploring the relationships and correlations between different geographical and atmospherical factors to understand their influence on landslide occurrence.

## Getting Started

To explore the code and reproduce the results, you will need to:

1.  **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have Python 3.x and the required libraries installed:
    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python numpy matplotlib
    ```
2.  **Install GIS Software (Optional):** ArcGIS Pro and SNAP might be required for certain geospatial data processing steps, depending on the specific notebook and workflow you are exploring.
3.  **Explore Jupyter Notebooks:** Navigate through the provided Jupyter Notebooks to understand the data processing pipelines, model implementations, training procedures, and prediction steps for both the geographical/atmospheric approach and the DInSAR-focused analysis.
4.  **Refer to Documentation:** The `Report.pdf` provides a detailed report on the "ESTIMATION AND ANALYSIS..." project, offering deeper insights into the methodology and findings.

## Project Focus

This project demonstrates the application of deep learning, specifically the U-net model, to the complex problem of landslide analysis and prediction. It explores the value of integrating diverse data sources, including geographical, atmospherical, and land deformation information derived from remote sensing techniques like DInSAR. The case study of the SR-530 Oso landslide serves as a crucial point for validation and understanding the practical applicability of the developed approaches.
